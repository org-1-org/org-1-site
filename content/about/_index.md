# About org-1.org

org-1.org is an open, neutral standards project focused on API schema stability,
canonical data shapes, and reliable transforms for real-world integration work.

Modern APIs evolve quickly, often without versioning or clear documentation of
breaking changes. org-1.org provides a shared foundation—schemas, transforms, and
tooling—to help developers handle drift safely and consistently across providers.

The project is maintained by **Benjamin Armstrong** (GitHub:
[@benthepsychologist](https://github.com/benthepsychologist)). Armstrong began
this work while solving his own data engineering challenges in research and
measurement-based workflows, and continues to steward the project as an open,
community-oriented standards effort.

Contributions from engineers, researchers, and practitioners are welcome.
