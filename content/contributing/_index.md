# Contributing to org-1.org

We welcome contributions that improve schema accuracy, transforms, documentation,
or tooling. All contributors are expected to follow these principles:

1. **Neutrality**
   Keep changes technical and apolitical.

2. **Evidence-driven**
   Schema updates should be based on real payloads or provider documentation.

3. **Minimal assumptions**
   Prefer explicit, observable behavior over speculation.

4. **Reproducibility**
   Include examples, test payloads, or references when possible.

5. **Clarity**
   Favor readable transforms and schemas over cleverness.

To get started, open an issue or submit a pull request in any org-1 repository.
