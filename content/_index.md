## A Neutral Standards Lab for Real-World API Data

APIs shape-shift daily. Documentation lags changes. Breaking fields appear
silently. Developers often find out only when production workflows fail.

org-1.org provides:

- Canonical JSON schemas for major API providers
- Transform libraries to normalize real-world payloads
- Drift detection and version tracking
- Open registry infrastructure for community contributions
- Tools to validate, normalize, and stabilize data pipelines

Everything is open-source, non-commercial, and engineering-focused.
