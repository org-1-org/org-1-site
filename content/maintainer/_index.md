## Maintainer

org-1.org is maintained by **Benjamin Armstrong**
GitHub: [@benthepsychologist](https://github.com/benthepsychologist)

Armstrong works in applied research and data-intensive workflows, where schema
drift and API inconsistency were persistent obstacles. The initial tooling that
became org-1.org emerged from attempts to solve these problems cleanly and
repeatably.

The project welcomes additional maintainers as the ecosystem grows.
