## Governance & Neutrality

org-1.org is committed to:

- **Neutrality** — No political, commercial, or ideological agenda.
- **Transparency** — All schemas, transforms, and specifications are public.
- **Community stewardship** — Decisions are guided by correctness, clarity, and utility.
- **Vendor independence** — We collaborate with API providers but remain vendor-neutral.
- **Open governance** — Roadmaps, discussions, and changes are documented publicly.

The project exists to support developers, researchers, and organizations that
depend on stable, predictable API behavior.
